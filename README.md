# esx_hospitaljob
This is a mini job I made and implemented into my FiveM Server. Players can take the role as a doctor and heal players or treat injuries.

I am not taking credit for this, this is all code that is referenced or used from the ESX Legacy ambulance job. I just made this for my server and I thought other people might want to utilize it as well. I don't care for making money or anything from this. Just take the resource and have fun.
