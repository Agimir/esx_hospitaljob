# esx_hospitaljob
This is a mini job I made and implemented into my FiveM Server. Players can take the role as a doctor and heal players or treat injuries.

I am not taking credit, this is all code that is referenced or used from the ESX Legacy ambulance job. I just made this for my server and I thought other people might want to utilize it as well.

# INSTALLATION

Input the SQL into your database.
Ensure or Start the resource in your CFG.
Run your server.

Congrats, you completed med school in like, 3 minutes. Go overcharge people for their bullet boo boos.
